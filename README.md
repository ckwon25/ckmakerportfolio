These are the two programs that I created for "BoatMeter" in VSCode using JavaScript. 

"Firestore Integrator" requests COM port data and uploads it to google Firestore.

"Simulated Instances" is a program designed to input generated data into google Firestore to test the functionality of the web applicationâ€™s backend.
